# User interface

The user interface (UI) source code can be found under `frontend` directory.
The UI is a *React* app, its dependencies are managed with *NPM*, and build is handled using *webpack* and *Babel*.

## Development

First, setup dependencies by running:

`npm i`

Then, start the local hot-reloaded development server by running:

`npm run start:dev`

Or, build the development build by running `npm run build:dev` and serve the files from `dist` directory with some other development server.
